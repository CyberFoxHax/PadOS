Editor to associate profiles with applications

Bug: Home Button doesn't work on Windows 10. GameBar overrides. Make a solution that can detect this and instruct the user to turn it off.
Consider: Sharing of profiles, consider alternatives to sqlite

BlockNavigator
	Bug: If the nested view has no blocks the entire system ceases to function
	Enhance: Reset navigator on exit
	Feature: scroll views

Navigator
	Bug: XInput does not go to sleep when a window is hidden. Making recycling windows a no-go
	Home button close, should it always reset the nav stack or should it return to last opened view?

Enhance: MainPanel refactor so the controls will contain it's function attachment, and not the index based on the angle.
Enhance: UI is too dark, on a bright background all the details disappear. Do this before beginning on the 4th view
