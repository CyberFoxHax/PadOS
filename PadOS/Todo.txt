Home Button doesn't work

BlockNavigator
	Bug: If the nested view has no blocks the entire system ceases to function
	Bug: Sometimes the first touch wont respond

Navigator
	Bug: XInput does not go to sleep when a window is hidden. Making recycling windows a no-go
	Home button, Nav where? Reset Nav?

Enhance: MainPanel refactor so the controls will contain it's function attachment, and not the index based on the angle.

Enhance: UI is too dark, on a bright background all the details disappear
