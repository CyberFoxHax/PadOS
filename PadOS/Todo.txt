Consider: Sharing of profiles
Bug: Home Button doesn't work

MainPanelEditor
	serialize savedata
	save data, are you sure?
	navigate from button list to dial
	don't forget special case for empty function
	make profile selector work

BlockNavigator
	Bug: If the nested view has no blocks the entire system ceases to function
	Bug: Sometimes the first touch wont respond
	Enhance: Reset navigator on exit
	Feature: scroll views

Navigator
	Bug: XInput does not go to sleep when a window is hidden. Making recycling windows a no-go
	Home button, Nav where? Reset Nav?

Enhance: MainPanel refactor so the controls will contain it's function attachment, and not the index based on the angle.
Enhance: UI is too dark, on a bright background all the details disappear. Do this before beginning on the 4th view
