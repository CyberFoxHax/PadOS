BlockNavigator
	Make sure nested nav also has the ability to disable navigation in cases where you'd like to implement your own mappings
	#Refactor
	Sometimes the first touch wont respond
    #Activated nested navigator
	#Exit nested navigator

Navigator
	Nav back, implement nav history
	XInput does not go to sleep when a window is hidden. Making recycling windows a no-go

MainPanelEditor
	Implement Radial controls when in nested navigation

MainPanel refactor so the controls will contain it's function attachment, and not the index based on the angle.

UI is too dark, on a bright background all the details disappear
