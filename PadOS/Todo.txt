BlockNavigator
	Feature: Make sure nested nav also has the ability to disable navigation in cases where you'd like to implement your own mappings
	Bug: If the nested view has no blocks the entire system ceases to function
	Bug: Sometimes the first touch wont respond
	Bug: Doesn't work on ItemsControl

Navigator
	Feature: Nav back, implement nav history
	Bug: XInput does not go to sleep when a window is hidden. Making recycling windows a no-go

MainPanelEditor
	Feature: Implement Radial controls when in nested navigation

Enhance: MainPanel refactor so the controls will contain it's function attachment, and not the index based on the angle.

Enhance: UI is too dark, on a bright background all the details disappear
